# Personal Website

This is the personal website of Joel Detweiler. [See it in action here](https://jdd1260.github.io/).

Started using Gatsby Starter - CeeVee | Design by Styleshout | Developed in React ⚛️ by Aman Mittal.

Additional development done by Joel Detweiler.


### Features:

* Based on the Ceevee site template, design by [Styleshout](https://www.styeshout.com/)
* Uses [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for building a static website using React.
* All personal information is isolated, so this site can be easily forked and modified for someone to reuse.
* Single Page Resume/Portfolio site
* Responsive Design, optimized for Mobile devices


### Develop

Run `yarn start` in the terminal to start a local server with hot-reloading of code changes.

Make changes you want by modifying the text files for each React component, found in `src/components/*/text.js`. No personal information is stored outside of these files. Make changes to images by adding/removing them in `src/assets/images`.

### Deploy

Deployment to github-pages is built in using `gh-pages`. Run `yarn deploy` to deploy to this repository's master branch. This project is also configured to deploy automatically using Travis-CI. No code changes will be needed for you to reuse this process, but you will need to follow the Travis [configuration guide](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/).
